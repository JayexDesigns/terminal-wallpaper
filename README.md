<p align="center">A simple terminal simulation for wallpaper engine</p>
<br/>
<p>The initial idea was to make an interactive terminal simulation for wallpaper engine, after finishing the project I realised wallpaper engine blocks the keyboard input so basically the whole project is now kind of useless. It would be a shame to let it die so it is available for wallpaper engine but it is not interactive.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>There are a small set of commands that you can use, there is also some scripts that can be executed. Here's a list of all of them:</p>
<ul>Commands:
    <li>'hello world'   ->   outputs 'hello world!'</li>
    <li>'help'   ->   shows list of commands, scripts and other info</li>
    <li>'ls'   ->   shows list of files in the current directory</li>
    <li>'clear'   ->   clears the command history</li>
    <li>'echo'   ->   show a message on the console</li>
</ul>
<ul>Scripts:
    <li>'infinite_download.sh'   ->   a script that simulates update the system infinitely, great as a wallpaper, you can stop it with ctrl + c</li>
    <li>'is_it_wednesday.sh'   ->   tells you if it is wednesday</li>
    <li>'time.sh'   ->   display the actual day and hour</li>
</ul>
